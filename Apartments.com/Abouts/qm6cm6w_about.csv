For September 1. The best deck in the history of Brighton. No view is better, no space more expansive, no living space more inviting. The interior at this four bed matches the exterior, quality beyond reproach and space that cannot be matched by words. Laundry in unit, central AC, parking available and 3.5 full baths! Nothing is newer, brighter, more modern or inviting. This one has it all in spades and more. One month broker fee listing.
164 Bigelow St is an apartment community located in Suffolk County and the 02135 ZIP Code."
