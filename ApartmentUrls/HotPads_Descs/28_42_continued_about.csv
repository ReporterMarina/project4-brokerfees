I have a room for rent in a two-bedroom unit in a quiet neighborhood in Medford. A female is preferred; please, no couples and no pets. Rent is $1100/month all inclusive(WIFI, heat, AC). Central AC in the unit. Available 9/15/23. Only the first month's (pro-rated) rent is required to move in. I can offer 9/1, but I want time to clean the room professionally before the next person moves in. This is a bedroom for rent in a 2-bedroom fully furnished apartment. I am a business professional looking to rent a bedroom (11' X 11') with a medium size closet in my apartment. It can come furnished(bed, bureau, short bookcase)or unfurnished. You must like animals because I have one small dog and a senior cat. I am looking for someone quiet, clean, and reliable. No couples. No pets, please. Some storage in the basement. Laundry in the basement. Easy street permit parking. Please note a copy of your credit report will be requested. If you are interested, I can show the space on Friday, 8/11, and Saturday, 8/12. The apartment is in a great location. Easy access to Tufts University. 7 min bike ride to Davis Square (red line) or 25-minute walk, 20-minute walk to the Green Line(E train), 2 min drive to 93 north or south, affordable Uber rides, two bus lines available also connect to Sullivan Station (orange line). Within walking distance, you will find two coffee shops, two bakeries, Oasis Brazilian Buffet, May's cafe restaurant, Bocelli's restaurant, Raso's Food and Bar, a convenience store, a Yoga studio, and dry cleaners. Go a little further in the opposite direction. You will find Dunkin Donuts, a Hot Yoga studio, and the sought-after Wegmans grocery store.
