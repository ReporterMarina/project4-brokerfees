This is in a prime location between Harvard and MIT, only 8 blocks (0.4 miles) to Central Sq subway station and restaurants, only 3 blocks to Whole Foods supermarket and Walgreens pharmacy, and only 5 blocks to the Charles River and its bike paths. There are also 8 neighborhood parks within an 8-block radius for plenty of green outdoor options! This unit is available for rent with a start date anytime Aug 15 - Sept 1 preferably for a 1-year lease. We are happy to do showings virtually or in person. We look forward to finding someone or a couple who would be a great fit -- especially non-partier(s) -- since we will be living next to each other. Thank you!","$2,900",1,1,800
