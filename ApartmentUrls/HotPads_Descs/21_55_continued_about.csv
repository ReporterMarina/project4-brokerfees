Carpet. The house is in Teele Square, near PJ Ryan's Pub and around the corner from Magnificent Muffin & Bagel and Renee's Cafe. Davis Square is an 8 minute walk from the front steps or a 3 minute bus ride on either the 87 or 88 bus lines, which stop at the end of our street. There are loads of options as far as restaurants, bars/pubs, and stores. The Minute Man bike path is practically at the end of the street so not only does it provide an even easier biking option for commuting to and from the city, it also provides easy access to parks, ponds, and other green spaces from Somerville to Concord. Overall, it's an awesome place in a fantastic neighborhood! (Reference #174910)","$2,500",2,1,N/A
