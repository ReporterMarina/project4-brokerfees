Ask about other units available in the building. There may be studios, one and 2 bedrooms available. Please confirm pet policy and which utilities are included in rent. Please note, it's a very competitive market so you must act fast. Landlord upfront costs vary from owner to owner. Expect to pay one month rent for the broker fee. I have 12 years of experience renting, selling, buying, and property managing in the city. Please do not hesitate to ask about other services.","$2,500",Studio,1,445
