First known for the location of the gunshot that prompted the Revolutionary War, Lexington has now become a sought-after suburb for those commuting to Boston but wanting calmer surroundings, without the hustle and bustle of city life. That being said, there is plenty to see and do here, including exploring diverse dining options, spending time in one of the many nearby parks, and visiting local historical sites. Boston is just 15-miles southeast, and nearby freeways can get you there with little effort. This home includes one off-street parking space, hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, and is pet-friendly.","$4,308",2,2,1100
