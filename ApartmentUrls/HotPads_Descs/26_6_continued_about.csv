https://www.hotpads.com/42-garden-st-boston-ma-02114-sker68/1/pad,"Welcome home! A unique 2-bed, 2-bath home in the heart of Beacon Hill. We recently gut-renovated it with modern fixtures and appliances while maintaining the historic charm. We prioritized multi-functional spaces, ample kitchen space with updated applianced, open concept living, storage space, and comfort. The kitchen has ample space for storage and many working surfaces. The appliances are Thermador and Miele all updated within the last year. The den is great for hosting and there is a fold out table if you want to have a true sit-down meal with friends and family (beyond the counter space which can seat 4 comfortably). Built into the cabinets is a desk with a second computer monitor hookup ready to go. Downstairs is a second bedroom with a murphy bed and plenty of storage. Use it as an office or as a bedroom or both! Each bedroom has it's own dedicated bathroom with heated floors and new fixtures. The home is centrally located two blocks from Flour Bakery, Whole Foods, and MGH, 4 min walk to Boston Common, 15 walk to the North End and near to the Red, Blue, and Green T lines.","$5,500",2,2,794
