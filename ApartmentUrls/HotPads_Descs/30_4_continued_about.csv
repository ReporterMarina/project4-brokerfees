You couldn't ask for a better location - across the street from popular hangout Bow Market, and just down the street from local favorites: the Neighborhood, Himalayan Kitchen, Bloc Cafe, and of course the original Union Square Donuts. Market Basket (grocery store) is also around the corner for ultimate convenience. Also a commuter's dream: the bus literally stops outside your door - goes inbound to Kendall/MIT (in 15 minutes!) and outbound to Arlington Center, while the new Green Line T stop a couple blocks away gives you direct access to all of Somerville and downtown Boston. Huge bi-level unit, with 4 bedrooms plus a separate office for any WFH-ers. The main floor has two bedrooms - one with a charming fireplace and the other with a large walk-in closet. One of the upstairs bedrooms is enormous and could easily be its own studio, easily accommodating a couch and desk with room to spare. The rest of the main floor is made up of living room, kitchen and bathroom. The updated kitchen has Quartz countertops, all new stainless steel appliances including dishwasher. Bathroom is fully gut-renovated, with large modern walk-in shower. Brand new white oak laminate flooring and tons of closets throughout. There is extra storage space in the unfinished basement plus laundry machines. The cherry on top is the beautiful outdoor space: huge backyard with stone pavers and large pergola - an urban oasis in the heart of it all! Due at signing are broker's fee, 1st month's rent, and security deposit (each 1 month's rent). Inquire to schedule a showing, this unit won't last!","$4,500",4,1,N/A
