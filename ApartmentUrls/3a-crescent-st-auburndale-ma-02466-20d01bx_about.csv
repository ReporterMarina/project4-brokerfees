This 2 bed/1 bath would be perfect as a bedroom + office. Bright, with lots of windows/natural light & lovely high ceilings, this little home is a fabulous alternative to condo living and feels much larger than the square footage. Electricity, heat, hot water, water & parking are all included in rent. Landlord prefers someone with a dog (as lovely backyard is shared & she has dogs). 2023-08-04"
