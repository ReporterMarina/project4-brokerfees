https://www.hotpads.com/25-laurel-st-roxbury-ma-02119-sp64pc/2/pad,"Welcome home to this bright and spacious Roxbury 3-bedroom duplex! You'll enjoy living close to downtown Boston, with convenient access to public transportation and a variety of local shops and restaurants. This unit offers plenty of space, with two full bathrooms, a laundry area, an eat-in kitchen, separate living and dining areas, and a few nooks for additional storage. The laundry is in-unit, so no more trips to the basement are laundromat. The bedrooms are ample sizes, and there's a decent amount of closet space here! The dining area can be used as a flex space for a home office or study. And as a bonus, the owner is making some significant upgrades like new mini-splits for heating & cooling, a new roof over your head (literally!), and an improved front entrance. No undergrad students, No smokers, and No pets, please.","$3,500",3,2,1200
