I am looking for someone to take over my current roommate's room as he is moving away! The apartment is across the street from Porter Sq and is a 1 minute walk to the Porter Red Line Station. We are next to a Star Market, Target, 24 hour CVS, Hardware Store, and lot's of restaurants. The apartment has IN UNIT W/D, Backyard, Gas Range Stove, pantry, and the bedrooms are very spacious! A little about me: I am 26, work in cybersecurity and I also DJ weddings on the side! I'm a very social person, I love having people over most of the time for game nights and hangouts. I am pretty laidback. In my free time I like to Bike, Swim, play video games, and go out. I also play some Volo sports like Volleyball & Kickball. What I'm looking for: Somebody that is mainly just a chill person, doesn't mind having people over, and friendly! Move in Costs are just First Month Rent ($1050), nothing else! Reach out if you are interested. Showings will need to be around 6pm and after on Weekdays just FYI.","$1,050",2,1,1000
