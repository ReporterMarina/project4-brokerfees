Unbelievable combination of quality and location! Walk to the trains and have the express bus right outside your front door! Amazing renovations, laundry in unit, central air and all great sized bedrooms matched with a kitchen to die for. If you want outdoor space, you have it here-- your own private balcony and two parking spots included in the rent. This is legitimately the best four bed in terms of location and quality that comes available in Brighton. 

One month brokerage fee applies.
