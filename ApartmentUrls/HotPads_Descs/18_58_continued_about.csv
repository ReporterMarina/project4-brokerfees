https://www.hotpads.com/3-ellsworth-ave-cambridge-ma-02139-skgpst/3/pad,"Charming loft style apartment (with one parking spot!) located on a quiet street yet within a short walk to restaurants, Harvard University, famous Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge Public Library and the Red Line. The place is flooded with natural light thanks to many skylights in the unit. Lots of storage throughout the unit and extra storage room in the basement. A wood burning stove undoubtedly adds to the charm but a gorgeous 600 sq. ft. deck is definitely stealing the show. The views will take your breath away; surrounding tall trees will make you forget you are in the middle of one of Massachusetts' busiest city. Grab your coffee and a book, take a zoom call or even bring out a yoga mat! OPEN HOUSE Sat 8/12 from 1pm-2pm","$2,600",1,1,948
