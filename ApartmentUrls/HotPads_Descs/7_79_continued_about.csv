One year lease starts on 9/1 with an option to move-in early in August. Monthly rent is $1300 plus utilities. All utilities will be split equal. The available room is shown in photos. All furniture shown will be removed before the lease starts. First and last month's rents are due at signing of the lease. Smoking is not permitted. The apartment features in-unit washer and dryer, hardwood flooring, gas fireplace, eat-in kitchen, updated bathroom, and TWO off-street parking spaces. There is a deck, overlooking a shared backyard. Fields corner and Shawmut T redline stations are 12-15 mins walk from the apartment. A variety of shops and restaurants are also at walking distance. I am in my 30s working in architecture/engineering/construction industry. My job is demanding, and I like to relax at home when I am not at work. Ideally, I am looking for a female working professional who is clean, responsible, quiet, and respectful.","$1,300",2,1,915
