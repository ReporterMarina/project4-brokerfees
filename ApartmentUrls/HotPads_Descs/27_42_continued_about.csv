The general rock solid brick and stone look, relative sound proofing, elevated perch (meaning nice views & extra light) fully backdrop this very eclectic, impressive space. So we're seeing a plethora of bold colors; nice mix of pastels and faded greys. Fab glass like hardwoods in all rooms (but for the finely tiled kitchen and bath). Air conditioning per multiple built in wall units. Your GIANT living room at 1 end has terrific double slider doors to a super inviting balcony. The other end segues to a wall window connecting the kitchen & easy views between rooms (LIV-KIT). Just below the window is a kick out mini counter + 2 stool chairs that collectively create the perfect breakfast bar between kitch and living. The living room is loaded with style--enjoy tasteful 2 tone paint work, a built in wall mounted big screen tv (at your option), a select few wall mounted mini shelvings, decoratively staggered. Terrific energy! Your Chefs kitchen really brings the noise; fab wrap around GRANITE counters, Full list of STAINLESS STEEL appliances; refrigerator, stove, dishwash, micro, et al). Extra maple cabinets to be had, extra counter space, backsplash & the cooking area window to instantly view your living room & balcony area (imagine cutting the tomatoes while simultaneously checking out the big screens 6pm news &/or hitting your surround sound remote from that same place). Ok, lets not get spoiled. Moving to the master bedroom we find another AC + the continuation of your sparkling hardwoods, like everywhere else - double sealed heat efficient windows, generous depth, color, plenty of cable, phone & electric jacks & even a superb walk in closet. Your 2nd bed is also an easy take, smaller yet very legit sized. Fine spacial bathroom with swanky wall and floor tile, fan, full tub & shower features, lighting, whole 9. The building is elevatored. The 2 parking spaces are fully deeded and assigned (1 @ covered garage). For laundry its easy access coin-op (at same living level--right down a short hall). To add to what's already an embarrassment of features - enjoy a no cost community work out room at lower level. The location is nearby a ton of shopping and general store fronts at Watertown Square. Bike path all the way to Boston is next door. T inbound is also walking distance + easy on/off to the pike is barely a mile away. The cherry on top here is that you have HEAT AND HW FULLY INCLUSIVE to your rent number. So cost fixation is also invited to the party. Ready date is September 1, potentially a tic sooner. 1 year terms, 1 at a time. Fee is a reduced half month (only); in all please expect 2.5 months in funds to sign it up. 1 smaller pet (to 30LBS) considered; small monthly add if so. This is living space that challenges comparison ! Call Jack Lambergs, Ingram Realty for addl details","$2,800",2,1,1045
