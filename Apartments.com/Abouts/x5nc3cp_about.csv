Available for 9/1 to 9/15 lease start - initial lease term through 8/31/24. Video tour and in-person tours available! This gorgeous penthouse has a PRIVATE ROOF DECK. The main entrance to this top-floor apartment is on the second floor, with just a few more stairs into the living room.

Original architectural details blend seamlessly with modern upgrades including recessed lighting and central a/c. The sundrenched living area features an updated kitchen with gas cooking, a dishwasher, and disposal, as well as the perfect dining nook and more than enough space for a sectional sofa.
