Classic style living/ dining room with a working glass fireplace in the dining room and pocket doors. Bathroom is off the hallway by the front door and has radiant heated floors and a towel warmer. Kitchen is stunning. Beautiful granite with tons of cabinets and little secret spots. Other bedroom is off the kitchen and has a cool built in closet with shelves and what not. Nice little back patio area great for grilling. Basement storage is private as well as the laundry. 1 parking space included! On street parking is really easy around here and the area has plenty of walk-ability. (Reference #137896),"$3,500",2,1,1200
