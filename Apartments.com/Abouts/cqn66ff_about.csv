These new apartments are near the Longwood Medical Area (LMA) and schools such as Harvard's School of Public Health, Northeastern, and Wentworth Institute of Technology. Tremont Street's diverse network of parks, restaurants, local shops, and grocers make Mission Hill a vibrant and accessible place to live.
