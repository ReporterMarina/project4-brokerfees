No other showings can be accommodated at this point in time. September 1st move-in date. Heat and hot water are included in the rent in this nice, South End, one bedroom unit. Professionally managed building in an excellent location near the T (Orange and Green Line), and many great restaurants. The sunny third floor unit features hardwood floors, ceiling fans, and tasteful crown moldings. The kitchen opens directly into the living space, and the bedroom can easily handle a full size bed (a queen bed fits as well if needed). This apartment is the perfect alternative for someone who is looking for a small apartment in the city but doesn't want the lone room a studio offers. There is no laundry in the building, but there is a laundromat less than 75 yards away. Don't hesitate; these units always rent quickly! Sorry, no pets or undergrads.
