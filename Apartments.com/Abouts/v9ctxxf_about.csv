Big space, this is the entire first floor of a house with lots of charm and attention to detail not normally found. Lots of natural light. Currently a 4 bed, we will frame off a 5th bedroom in part of the living room area to create an additional room while maintaining a balanced flow in the overall living space - but still plenty of common area with living room, kitchen and dining room.
Brand new back porch/deck and renovated kitchen.
