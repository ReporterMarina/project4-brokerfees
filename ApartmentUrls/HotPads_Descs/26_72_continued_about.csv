This Oak Square 2+ BR has undergone extensive updating with new kitchen with dishwasher and disposal, new bath, newly sanded floors and fresh paint throughout. Laundry hook ups right in the pantry. Nice front enclosed porch for sunrises and coffee. Bonus den/office space. Street parking, but its easy here and no permit required. Its a quiet home, so the folks downstairs are hoping to keep it that way. If that sounds like you, please contact us to schedule a viewing. NO PETS OR SMOKERS PLEASE.","$2,600",2,1,N/A
