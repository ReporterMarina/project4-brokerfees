UNBELIEVABLE location! Even better roof deck! Laundry in unit, gut renovated from top to bottom with new kitchen and two new full baths. Brighton Center is literally at your doorstep! Walk to everything and save money on Uber! Devlin's is next door, Porter Belly's is down the street, Green Briar is across the road and the green line is just a half mile away too! Location, location, location is a total cliche but this place is in the middle of everything. NO BROKER FEE.
332 Washington St is an apartment community located in Suffolk County and the 02135 ZIP Code."
