*The building was moved to its present site in 1858. It is thought to have originally been a depot either for the Watertown Branch or Mount Auburn Railroad. Its precise lineage has yet to be fully documented, but its profile strongly suggests its use as a depot for early railroads which served Cambridge. Despite its relocation, this building is one of the few remnants of the commuter railroads for Cambridgeâ€™s distinct development. Its unique form and its significance for Cambridge development make it worthy of recognition.
