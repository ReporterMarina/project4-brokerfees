Large studio with luxury touches directly overlooking the Charles river and the Boston skyline. Watch the crew boats go back and forth. Run or bike on the brand new river path that's literally a stone's throw away. Fully and tastefully furnished, including a leather corner sofa, designer coffee table, tall cafe table, wall unit with desk, designer rug, oil paintings, wine rack. Bonus: there is a Murphy bed, which gives you the option of having a large room for entertaining guests by folding the bed into the wall. 32"" LCD TV (the apt faces South, so the indoor HD antenna captures all the public TV channels really well). Two closets and built-in shelves. Small, but fully stocked, modern kitchen. Includes your own parking space and storage bin in the basement. There is a shared laundry room with washers/dryers. Includes a vacuum cleaner, iron, pots+pans, dishes, utensils, and other supplies--you need nothing to move in. Sits literally on the Cambridge/Watertown line. 2 min walk to the river and its biking/running paths, 2 min drive to Arsenal/Watertown Mall, 6 min drive to Mass Pike, 8-12 min walk to Mt. Auburn and Arsenal St bus lines, 25 min walk to Harvard Square. Note: it's not terribly convenient for daily public transportation use--you'll be much happier with a car or a bike here. (Personally, I commuted to work by bike on the Charles river bike path all the way downtown when I lived here.) Very quiet and relaxing--perfect for a grad student or a visiting professor--you will get a lot of work done here. Feels like a bed and breakfast, yet so close to the heart of Cambridge. You will want to live here as soon as you walk in--the view alone is amazing. Plus, you literally don't need to bring anything--just move in and enjoy. There's even a commuter bike in the bike room should you want to use it. No smoking and no pets. One person only (it's just too small for two to be comfortable). Available now for a 6-12 month lease (can be extended; preference given to longer-term applicants). Includes heat and hot water (the only utility you have to pay is electric, which is pretty low). There is also a large built-in air conditioner. First, last, and one month security deposit due at lease signing. Credit check and/or proof of income required. Thanks for looking!","$1,950",Studio,1,406
