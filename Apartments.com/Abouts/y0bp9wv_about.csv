A residential community located on the waterfront of Boston's historic North End. A picturesque neighborhood reminiscent of the best of Italy, yet steps away from Boston's vibrant Financial District, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Haymarket, the Freedom Trail, and Downtown Crossing. Residents walk the streets visiting the country's finest Italian restaurants, each with a distinct atmosphere and flavor. They do their grocery shopping among the many markets and bakeries filled with homemade delicacies, exquisite pastries, and friendly faces. Century-old cafes dot the narrow streets - perfect for leisurely cappuccino sipping, newspaper reading, and people-watching. Every urban convenience and pleasure is within reach.
Christopher Columbus Plaza is an apartment community located in Suffolk County and the 02109 ZIP Code. This area is served by the Boston attendance zone.
