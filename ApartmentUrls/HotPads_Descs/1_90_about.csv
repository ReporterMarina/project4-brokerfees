The apartment has 3 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms. Rooms are on the smaller side. The apartment has just been professionally painted and cleaned. There is a nice shared deck off the front of the house. Both heat and hot water are included. Laundry is on site! Small pets are ok. The buses are just about 100 yards away.
