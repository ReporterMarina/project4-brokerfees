A dog lives here too! This 2 bedroom house in North Medford has 1.5 baths + a finished guest room in the basement. Its walking distance to the Fells and Wrights Pond. There's ample common space with a large chef's kitchen, dining & living rooms, screened in porch, hot tub, 2 firepits, yard w/ patio, free laundry, and garden. There is a spare room in the basement that can be used for friends to crash (not suitable for a full time rental). Your housemate(s): Late 30s female and female bulldog. The human works professionally as an engineer and in her spare time enjoys building things (home improvement projects, artwork, gardening), socializing (usually lowkey friend hangs a few nights a week), and outdoorsy things (camping & skiing). The bulldog sleeps most of the day and will extort you for pets or try to take over the world who really knows. In her own words ""give me all the pets and treats but keep kids and other dogs out of my territory"". You: Ideally a 20-40s professional that are a fellow engineer, animal, nature, art, adventure, and/or cooking enthusiast. An ideal housemate wants to live in community where we can both invite friends over to enjoy the space and sometimes share meals. Would accept couples for an adjusted price. Since the house can hold 3 people there is a flexible move in date.","$1,350",2,1.5,1586
