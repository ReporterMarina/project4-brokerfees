From the former Powder House Community School, a building of concrete & steel just outside of Davis Square, the designer carved beautiful and rich LOFT style living spaces. The ceilings are high, the windows are huge, and there are lots of different places to get outside. While all different, the layout of each unit is artful and inviting. Come and learn more about the project and experience the CALA concept for yourself! Please note that photos are of a model unit.","$3,100",1,1,769
