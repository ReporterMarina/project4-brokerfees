Walk past the gardenia-scented entrance to a stylish 4-room apartment that's itself a work of art. 1 bed and bath in 750+ sq. ft. feels much bigger because the new maple floors reflect light from windows on all sides. This open-plan layout enables you to see from LR though Kit to DR as if in a loft, while your bedroom, bath, and new in-unit laundry remain private. Off the LR, is a small deck with climbing roses, bistro table, pergola, and lights a perfect spot to sip coffee and listen to birdsong. Nothing about the unit is ""builder grade,"" rather it's full of designer details like the sleek sink faucet (Graff Ametis), the dimmable kitchen pendants that add a touch of romance, the lighted glass display (a great conversation piece), and the European towel warmer. Add to this is the daisy yellow double shower and bench with Italian marble floor. Nest thermostat and central AC keep it cool. This is a pied-a-terre for those who appreciate quality and want to feel their spirits soar when they walk in the door. It also features on-street parking in a quiet neighborhood, near bike path, Mass. Ave. bus lines, Davis Square, and loads of North Cambridge amenities. Easy trip to Rte. 2 ad 95. Concierge management.","$3,100",1,1,750
