Originally built by the American poet Longfellow as the carriage house for one of his daughters, the house is adjacent to the Longfellow House and Garden (now a National Park property) and a brief walk from both Harvard Square and the Charles River. The connected but distinct living and dining areas offer access to a charming fenced garden with a private deck. An efficient kitchen with generous counter space, a powder room, and a laundry room complete the first floor. Upstairs, there is a primary suite with twin closets and a full bath, a second light-filled bedroom, a third bedroom well suited for a home office, and a second full bath. The attached garage with two tandem parking spots as well as driveway parking allow one to live a true urban lifestyle on bike or foot.","$7,000",3,2.5,1500
