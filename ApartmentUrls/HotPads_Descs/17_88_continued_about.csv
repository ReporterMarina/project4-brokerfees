Lots of big windows and lots of light! Must see! Conveniently located building in the heart of the city. Near lots of restaurants, shops, and grocery stores. Ask about other units available in the building. There may be studios, one and 2 bedrooms available. Please confirm pet policy and which utilities are included in rent. Please note, it's a very competitive market so you must act fast. Landlord upfront costs vary from owner to owner. Expect to pay one month rent for the broker fee. I have 12 years of experience renting, selling, buying, and property managing in the city. Please do not hesitate to ask about other services.","$3,150",1,1,678
