This completely renovated and over-sized one-bedroom loft features high ceilings and extra large windows as well as beautiful hardwood floors throughout. The grand proportions of the living space make it feel much larger than the actual generous square footage. There is in-unit laundry, great closet space, HVAC and windows on each end of the unit for good cross ventilation. Located very close to South Station, Tufts Medical and Dental facilities , Boston Common/Public Gardens, this home is also just 2 blocks from the highway and turnpike access ramps. It is convenient to the recreational and cultural facilities of the waterfront, Seaport and the many amenities of mid-town including the retail and theater district. A must see!","$3,400",1,1,1043
