Large, colorful homes and historic buildings mark this neighborhood with local charm that you won't want to miss. Exuding a college-town vibe, Riverside is situated directly south of Harvard University, so though the neighborhood feels family-friendly, it's also very youthful due to the proximity to this prestigious university. But Harvard isn't the only school in walking distance of Riverside. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (known as MIT) is just two miles from Riverside, making this neighborhood an educational hub. Whether you want to walk, drive, or make use of public transit, by bus or subway, this area is very commuter-friendly.","$5,700",4,2.5,1500
