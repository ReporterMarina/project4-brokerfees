Today, its heights provide a different advantage- some of the best views of the city of Boston. Fort Hill's landmark Cochituate Standpipe, a post-revolutionary structure designed to hold water, was opened to the public in recent years and the climb up the structure unfolds beautiful and unique views of the city of Boston. Despite its rolling landscape, or rather because of it, Fort Hill is easily accessible through various public transportation routes, and its very own Dudley Square MBTA station connects 15 different bus routes.
